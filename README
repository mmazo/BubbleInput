About

Simple input content tokenizer and validator for input fields and textareas. Bubble input is free to use in any applications and comes under MIT license. It is cross-browser compatible and was tested in IE7+, FF, Chrome, Opera and Safari.

Idea

The idea of bubble input is not new and that was not me who 'invented' it. That was my colleague and good friend of mine, Marius M. (devilx) who did a first working prototype. Current version is just my own variation on this topic.

Features

Converts input fields and textareas into bubble input areas.
Adjustable content separation and validation per bubble area.
Intuitive input field like content input.
Keyboard and Mouse navigation.
Immediate content validation and conversion in 'bubbles'
Bubbles drag and drop and sorting between and within bubble areas.
Content validation after each sorting action.
Paste support for content input.
Prevents inserting double content.
Easy combination with jQuery input-related plugins. Such as autocomplete.
Simple styling for all bubble states: valid, invalid, selected, editable.
Object oriented design following prototipical inheritance rules.

Known Issues

In Opera user needs to press 'enter' to convert pasted content into bubbles. It does not happen automatically as in all other browsers.
In IE7 current bubble styling needs to be prettified.
